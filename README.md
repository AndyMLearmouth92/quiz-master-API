# Wordle API

A simple API that returns quiz questions to be used in different quiz games. I mainly built this to use with my React quiz project but it could be used in different scenarios.

The API is hosted here: https://quiz-master-data.cyclic.cloud

## Getting started

To access the quiz questions: https://quiz-master-data.cyclic.cloud/questions

To run the application on your local machine, you can simply install the node modules using:

```bash
npm install
```

## Optimisations

For optimisations, I would add more questions to the list and reorganise/tidy up the file structure.
